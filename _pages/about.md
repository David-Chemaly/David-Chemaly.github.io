I'm currently a 2nd year PhD candidate in Astronomy at the University of Cambridge fully-funded by the [Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Programme](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk/). My research focuses on utilizing the statistical bayesian framework and all sort of machine learning models to uncover the various underlying properties of dark matter.

Prior, I pursued my undergratuade and master studies at the University of Montreal at the [Ciela institute](https://ciela.science/) where I worked on applying deep neural networks to measure the mass of supermassive black holes.

I would love to hear from you!
